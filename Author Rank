TI  - Retrograde BMP Signaling at the Synapse: A Permissive Signal for Synapse
      Maturation and Activity-Dependent Plasticity.

AB  - At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the loss of retrograde,
      trans-synaptic BMP signaling causes motoneuron terminals to have fewer synaptic
      boutons, whereas increased neuronal activity results in a larger synapse with
      more boutons. Here, we show that an early and transient BMP signal is necessary
      and sufficient for NMJ growth as well as for activity-dependent synaptic
      plasticity. This early critical period was revealed by the temporally controlled 
      suppression of Mad, the SMAD1 transcriptional regulator. Similar results were
      found by genetic rescue tests involving the BMP4/5/6 ligand Glass bottom boat
      (Gbb) in muscle, and alternatively the type II BMP receptor Wishful Thinking
      (Wit) in the motoneuron. These observations support a model where the muscle
      signals back to the innervating motoneuron's nucleus to activate presynaptic
      programs necessary for synaptic growth and activity-dependent plasticity.
      Molecular genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies show that genes involved in 
      NMJ growth and plasticity, including the adenylyl cyclase Rutabaga, the Ig-CAM
      Fasciclin II, the transcription factor AP-1 (Fos/Jun), and the adhesion protein
      Neurexin, all depend critically on the canonical BMP pathway for their effects.
      By contrast, elevated expression of Lar, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 
      found to be necessary for activity-dependent plasticity, rescued the phenotypes
      associated with the loss of Mad signaling. We also find that synaptic structure
      and function develop using genetically separable, BMP-dependent mechanisms.
      Although synaptic growth depended on Lar and the early, transient BMP signal, the
      maturation of neurotransmitter release was independent of Lar and required later,
      ongoing BMP signaling.
